    "description": "This dataset provides daily surface meteorological data at 0.1\u00b0x0.1\u00b0 spatial resolution for the period from 2015 to present as input for agro-ecological studies. This dataset is based on the hourly ECMWF ERA5 data at surface level and is referred to as AgERA5. Acquisition and pre-processing of the original ERA5 data is a complex and specialized job. By providing the AgERA5 dataset, users are freed from this work and can directly start with meaningful input for their analyses and modelling. To this end, the variables provided in this dataset match the input needs of most agro-ecological models.\n\nData were aggregated to daily time steps at the local time zone and corrected towards a finer topography at a 0.1\u00b0 spatial resolution. The correction to the 0.1\u00b0 grid was realized by applying grid and variable-specific regression equations to the ERA5 dataset interpolated at 0.1\u00b0 grid. The equations were trained on ECMWF's operational high-resolution atmospheric model (HRES) at a 0.1\u00b0 resolution. This way the data is tuned to the finer topography, finer land use pattern and finer land-sea delineation of the ECMWF HRES model.\n\nThe data was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nThis dataset is marked as experimental because the integration in this backend has not yet been fully validated. Use with caution.",
